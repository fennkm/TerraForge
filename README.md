# TerraForge

People who create fictional worlds for mediums such as books, films, and video games lack a suitable program they can use to carve out the topology of their worlds in 3D. Such a program must be easy to use for artists and non-artists alike, as well as giving suitable tools and visuals to create a compelling and immersive 3D environment. TerraForge has been developed to fill this gap. Serving as an all-in-one tool that allows the easy creation and sharing of highly detailed islands and continents to assist in the worldbuilding process.

Please see the included report for more information regarding the features and development of TerraForge.
